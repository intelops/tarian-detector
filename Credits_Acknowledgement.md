# 🎖️ Tarian Detector Credits & Acknowledgements

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks 🙏 to the whole open-source eBPF community. Your passion and commitment to open-source software development have been pivotal in the development and growth of Tarian Detector.

We're particularly grateful for the insights and innovations provided by several key projects, which have had a significant influence on Tarian Detector.

## 🌟 Acknowledgements

- **_[KubeArmor](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor):_** An initiative that offers runtime protection for Kubernetes and other cloud workloads. Your effort to improve the security of cloud-based systems has greatly inspired our work.

- **_[Tetragon (from Cilium)](https://github.com/cilium/cilium):_** The innovative Tetragon component provides powerful real-time, eBPF-based security observability and runtime enforcement. The component's capabilities have been invaluable to our understanding of eBPF-based security.

- **_[Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee):_** Tracee uses eBPF technology to tap into the system and provides access to hundreds of events that help understand system behavior. The principles and techniques incorporated in Tracee have been instrumental in shaping the functionalities of Tarian Detector.

We want to express our sincere gratitude for the influence and inspiration these projects have provided. They represent the best of what the open-source community can achieve when we collaborate and share our knowledge.

In conclusion, we're immensely grateful for the vibrant open-source community that surrounds and supports us. We look forward to continuing to learn from and contribute to this amazing community. 🚀
